# Kickstarting with Excel


Title : Analysis of the Kickstarter Dataset
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
	The project aims to use the dataset 'kickstart' to futher discover the fundarising outcome from the song 'Fver' by Lousie in a short amount of time. 
	The goal is to find the detail of the raltionship of the different campaigns fared between their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The analysis of outcome based of lauch date was initiale by creating the lauch date based on the data on columne J and transferring it to the exact lauch date. 
	Then the pivot table was used to show the relationship between months and the outcomes. 
	The line  chart was created after to provide the visial presentation which is saved as Theather_outcomes_vs_Launch.png
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	The analysis of outcomes based on goals was created by allocated goal into different doantion range and presenting the successful rate and failed rate on a line graph. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	One of the chanllange faced was the format of the launch date cell which was general. To show as a date, it was needed to be changed to 'short date' format to sproperly show it. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	The successful outcomes peaked in May same as the failed outcomes which shows that the most theater plays was happening in May.
	There are more successful outcomes compared to Failed ones in this short period.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	There is no expectation towards cancellation as goal no matter in what goal range.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The dataset has the currency shown in the currency filter but there is no currency covergence function related to.
	The Launch date analysis was analysed by months but the months can be in different years which shows less reliability and could not show the trend. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	Graphs with countries as rows can be developed to show the different outcomes between countries.
